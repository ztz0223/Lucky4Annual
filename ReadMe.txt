                Document for the Annual software

1. Just for the fourth prize of the annual party.

2. 4 types for the prize:
    A) Married without child           42      (15.1%)     -- 4 gifts
    B) Married with child under 3      72      (25.9%)     -- 7 gifts
    C) Married with child above 3      116     (41.4%)     -- 11 gifts
    D) Single                          49      (17.6%)     -- 5 gifts

3. When using the software, first, you should import the candidates'
name/id/type list, as following in a .csv format file(a simple excel format),
comma as seperator:
    Rock Zhou, 123456, A
    Tom Jerry, 555555, C
    ...
and you can refer to the import_sample.csv in the local file path.

4. Every operation is saved in the db file -- Annual.db, including candidates
list, lucky list, so you can close the running software and then delete the 
db file, and reimport the candidates, if any problem.

5. The codes can be modified, or you can mail to me for any comments, thanks.

6. The project has been upload into GitHub.
